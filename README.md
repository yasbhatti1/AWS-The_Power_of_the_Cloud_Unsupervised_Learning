# AWS-The Power of the Cloud - Unsupervised Learning

You are a Senior Manager at the Advisory Services team on a [Big Four firm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Four_accounting_firms). One of your most important clients, a prominent investment bank, is interested in offering a new cryptocurrencies investment portfolio for its customers, however, they are lost in the immense universe of cryptocurrencies. They ask you to help them make sense of it all by generating a report of what cryptocurrencies are available on the trading market and how they can be grouped using classification.  

In this activity, I will use unsupervivsed learning and Amazon SageMaker skills into action by clustering cryptocurrencies and creating plots to present my results.

I will accomplish the following main tasks:

* **[Data Preprocessing](#Data-Preprocessing):** Prepare data for dimension reduction with PCA and clustering using K-Means.

* **[Reducing Data Dimensions Using PCA](#Reducing-Data-Dimensions-Using-PCA):** Reduce data dimension using the `PCA` algorithm from `sklearn`.

* **[Clustering Cryptocurrencies Using K-Means](#Clustering-Cryptocurrencies-Using-K-Means):** Predict clusters using the cryptocurrencies data using the `KMeans` algorithm from `sklearn`.

* **[Visualizing Results](#Visualizing-Results):** Create some plots and data tables to present your results.
* **[Deploying Notebook](#Deploying Notebook-Amazon Sagemaker):** Deploy your notebook to Amazon SageMaker.
